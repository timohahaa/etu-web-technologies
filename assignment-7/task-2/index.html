        The Go gopher is an iconic mascot and one of the most distinctive features of the Go project. In this post we’ll
        talk about its origins, evolution, and behavior.
        Renee French was commissioned to design a T-shirt for an annual fundraiser and out came the gopher.
        The gopher next made an appearance at Bell Labs, as Bob Flandrena’s avatar in the Bell Labs mail system. Other
        Renee drawings became avatars for ken, r, rsc, and others. (Of course, Peter Weinberger’s was his own iconic
        face.)
        For the open source launch in 2009, Renee suggested adapting the WFMU gopher as a mascot. And the Go gopher was
        born.
        (The gopher has no name, and is called just the “Go gopher”.)
